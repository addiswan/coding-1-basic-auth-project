# Seed the database with sample data.
# Run this script once with: python seed_db.py

# Once you have seeded your data, you can run sqlite3 users.db in the terminal
# This opens a sqlite3 shell and you can run commands like:
# - .tables to see all tables
# - SELECT * FROM users; to see all users
# - .exit to exit the shell
# *Note: If you try to seed data and get an error about "UNIQUE constraint failed: users.username", it means you have already seeded the database.
# If you need to seed the database again, simply delete the users.db file and run the seed script again.
